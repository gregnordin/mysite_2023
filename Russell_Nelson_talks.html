                pattern. It is time for a home-centered Church, supported by

                His Atonement, to assist them in making and keeping their
                covenants with God, and to strengthen and seal their families.
                In this complex world today, this is not easy. The adversary is
                increasing his attacks on faith and upon us and our families at
                an exponential rate. To survive spiritually, we need
                counterstrategies and proactive plans. Accordingly, we now want
                to put in place organizational adjustments that will further
                fortify our members and their families.</em

                our mothers and sisters. ... Brethren, your first and foremost
                duty as a bearer of the priesthood is to love and care for your
                wife. Become one with her. Be her partner. Make it easy for her
                to want to be yours. No other interest in life should take
                priority over building an eternal relationship with her. Nothing
                on TV, a mobile device, or a computer is more important than her
                well-being. Take an inventory of how you spend your time and
                where you devote your energy. That will tell you where your
                heart is. Pray to have your heart attuned to your wife's heart.
                Seek to bring her joy. Seek her counsel, and listen. Her input
                will improve your output. If you have a need to repent because
                of the way you have treated the women closest to you, begin now.

                earth at this crucial time because of your premortal spiritual
                valor. You are among the finest, most valiant men who have ever
                come to the earth. Satan knows who you are and who you were
                premortally, and he understands the work that must be done
                before the Savior returns. And after millennia of practicing his
                cunning arts, the adversary is experienced and incorrigible.
                Gratefully, the priesthood we hold is far stronger than are the
                wiles of the adversary. I plead with you to be the men and young
                men the Lord needs you to be. Make your focus on daily
                repentance so integral to your life that you can exercise the
                priesthood with greater power than ever before. This is the only
                way you will keep yourself and your family spiritually safe in
                the challenging days ahead.</em

                has profound implications for your lives. The restoration of the
                priesthood, along with the Lord's counsel to Emma, can guide and
                bless each of you. How I yearn for you to understand that the
                restoration of the priesthood is just as relevant to you as a
                woman as it is to any man. Because the Melchizedek Priesthood
                has been restored, both covenant-keeping women and men have
                access to "all the spiritual blessings of the church" or, we
                might say, to all the spiritual treasures the Lord has for His
                children.</em

                keeps those covenants, and who participates worthily in
                priesthood ordinances, has direct access to the power of God.
                Those who are endowed in the house of the Lord receive a gift of
                God's priesthood power by virtue of their covenant, along with a
                gift of knowledge to know how to draw upon that power.</em

                upon each of your hearts because I believe it will change your

                qualify for the blessings of the temple. As members of the

                explain that the blessings of the temple are available to any
                and all people who will prepare themselves. But before they can
                enter a dedicated temple, they need to qualify. The Lord wants

                General conference next April will be different from any

                member and every family will prepare for a unique conference
                that will commemorate the very foundations of the restored
                gospel. You may wish to begin your preparation by reading afresh
                Joseph Smith's account of the First Vision as recorded in the
                Pearl of Great Price. Our course of study for next year in Come,
                Follow Me is the Book of Mormon. You may wish to ponder
                important questions such as, "How would my life be different if
                my knowledge gained from the Book of Mormon were suddenly taken
                away?" or "How have the events that followed the First Vision
                made a difference for me and my loved ones?" Also, with the Book
                of Mormon videos now becoming available, you may wish to
                incorporate them in your individual and family study. Select
                your own questions. Design your own plan. Immerse yourself in
                the glorious light of the Restoration. As you do, general
                conference next April will be not only memorable; it will be
                unforgettable.</em

                cleansing, healing, and strengthening power. Then we can feel
                enduring peace and joy, even during turbulent times. This is
                exactly why the Lord has implored us to stand in holy places and
                "be not moved."</em

                your spiritual and emotional preparation. ... First, he [Moroni]
                helped them create areas where they would be safe-"places of
                security" he called them. Second, he prepared "the minds of the
                people to be faithful unto the Lord." And third, he never
                stopped preparing his people-physically or spiritually. Let us
                consider these three principles.</em

                Israel, so many decisions become easier. So many issues become
                nonissues! You know how best to groom yourself. You know what to
                watch and read, where to spend your time, and with whom to
                associate. You know what you want to accomplish. You know the
                kind of person you really want to become. Now, my dear brothers
                and sisters, it takes both faith and courage to let God prevail.
                It takes persistent, rigorous spiritual work to repent and to
                put off the natural man through the Atonement of Jesus Christ.
                It takes consistent, daily effort to develop personal habits to
                study the gospel, to learn more about Heavenly Father and Jesus
                Christ, and to seek and respond to personal revelation. During
                these perilous times of which the Apostle Paul prophesied, Satan
                is no longer even trying to hide his attacks on God's plan.
                Emboldened evil abounds. Therefore, the only way to survive
                spiritually is to be determined to let God prevail in our lives,
                to learn to hear His voice, and to use our energy to help gather
                Israel.</em

                resolve. I have wondered what I might say to conclude this
                conference that would send you forth with the optimism about the
                future that I know the Lord wants you to feel. We live in a
                glorious age, foreseen by prophets for centuries. This is the
                dispensation when no spiritual blessing will be withheld from
                the righteous. Despite the world's commotion, the Lord would
                have us look forward to the future "with joyful anticipation."
                Let us not spin our wheels in the memories of yesterday. The
                gathering of Israel moves forward. The Lord Jesus Christ directs
                the affairs of His Church, and it will achieve its divine
                objectives. The challenge for you and me is to make certain that
                each of us will achieve his or her divine potential. Today we
                often hear about "a new normal." If you really want to embrace a
                new normal, I invite you to turn your heart, mind, and soul
                increasingly to our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ.

                commitment to make your home your primary sanctuary of faith
                should never end. As faith and holiness decrease in this fallen

                that He has been, and is, indeed leading us along, as we seek to
                hear Him. He wants us to grow and to learn, even through-perhaps

                >The Lord does not require perfect faith for us to have access
                to His perfect power. But He does ask us to believe. My dear
                brothers and sisters, my call to you this Easter morning is to
                start today to increase your faith. Through your faith, Jesus
                Christ will increase your ability to move the mountains in your
                life, even though your personal challenges may loom as large as
                Mount Everest. Your mountains may be loneliness, doubt, illness,
                or other personal problems. Your mountains will vary, and yet
                the answer to each of your challenges is to increase your faith.
                That takes work. Lazy learners and lax disciples will always
                struggle to muster even a particle of faith. To do anything well
                requires effort. Becoming a true disciple of Jesus Christ is no
                exception. Increasing your faith and trust in Him takes effort.

                >Become an engaged learner. Immerse yourself in the scriptures
                to understand better Christ's mission and ministry. Know the
                doctrine of Christ so that you understand its power for your
                life. Internalize the truth that the Atonement of Jesus Christ
                applies to you. He took upon Himself your misery, your mistakes,
                your weakness, and your sins. He paid the compensatory price and
                provided the power for you to move every mountain you will ever
                face. You obtain that power with your faith, trust, and
                willingness to follow Him.</em

                miracles. Miracles come according to your faith in the Lord.
                Central to that faith is trusting His will and timetable-how and
                when He will bless you with the miraculous help you desire. Only
                your unbelief will keep God from blessing you with miracles to
                move the mountains in your life. The more you learn about the
                Savior, the easier it will be to trust in His mercy, His
                infinite love, and His strengthening, healing, and redeeming
                power. The Savior is never closer to you than when you are

                faithful. Take your questions to the Lord and to other faithful
                sources. Study with the desire to believe rather than with the
                hope that you can find a flaw in the fabric of a prophet's life
                or a discrepancy in the scriptures. Stop increasing your doubts
                by rehearsing them with other doubters. Allow the Lord to lead

                the temptation to care more about the things of this world than
                the things of God. It means trusting the doctrine of Christ more
                than the philosophies of men. It means delighting in truth,
                denouncing deception, and becoming “humble followers of Christ.”
                It means choosing to refrain from anything that drives the
                Spirit away. It means being willing to “give away” even our
                favorite sins.</em

                perfect in this life, nor does it mean that your problems will
                magically evaporate—because they won't. And it does not mean
                that you won't still make mistakes. But overcoming the world
                does mean that your resistance to sin will increase. Your heart
                will soften as your faith in Jesus Christ increases. Overcoming
                the world means growing to love God and His Beloved Son more
                than you love anyone or anything else.</em

                each time you do anything good—things that “the natural man”
                would not do—you are overcoming the world.</em

                cultivate faith in Jesus Christ by repenting daily and keeping
                covenants that endow us with power. We stay on the covenant path
                and are blessed with spiritual strength, personal revelation,
                increasing faith, and the ministering of angels. Living the
                doctrine of Christ can produce the most powerful virtuous cycle,
                creating spiritual momentum in our lives.</em

                above the pull of this fallen world by blessing us with greater
                charity, humility, generosity, kindness, self-discipline, peace,
                and rest.</em

                >Now, you may be thinking this sounds more like hard spiritual
                work than rest. But here is the grand truth: while the world
                insists that power, possessions, popularity, and pleasures of
                the flesh bring happiness, they do not! They cannot! What they
                do produce is nothing but a hollow substitute for “the blessed
                and happy state of those [who] keep the commandments of God.”
                The truth is that it is much more exhausting to seek happiness
                where you can never find it! However, when you yoke yourself to
                Jesus Christ and do the spiritual work required to overcome the
                world, He, and He alone, does have the power to lift you above
                the pull of this world.</em

                Just as the rules that my wife and I developed for our children
                were motivated by love, God's laws reflect His perfect love for
                each of us. His laws keep us spiritually safe and help us to
                progress eternally.</em

                The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that God “institute[d] laws
                whereby [we] could have a privilege to advance like himself.”
                God's greatest blessings are reserved for those who obey His
                laws, as He explained: “For all who will have a blessing at my
                hands shall abide the law which was appointed for that
                blessing.” God's laws are motivated entirely by His infinite
                love for us and His desire for us to become all we can
                become.</em

                It is precisely because we do care deeply about all of God's

                My responsibility is to educate and prepare you also for your
                immortal experience—meaning, how to gain eternal life. Teachings
                of the finest institutions of higher learning have limitations,
                because secular education generally ignores three major truths
                that are rarely addressed: First, each of us is going to die.
                Second, because of Jesus Christ, each of us is going to be
                resurrected and become immortal. And third, Judgment Day is
                ahead for each of us. These three absolute truths should form
                the foundation of your spiritual education.</em

                tomorrow, let alone eternal life. But please don't be uninformed
                or naïve about the opportunities and challenges of mortality. In
                that spirit, you need to understand three fundamental truths
                that will help you prepare your future course: First, know the
                truth about who you are. Second, know the truth about what
                Heavenly Father and His Son have offered you. And third, know

                foremost, you are a child of God. Second, as a member of the
                Church, you are a child of the covenant. And third, you are a
                disciple of Jesus Christ. Tonight, I plead with you not to
                replace these three paramount and unchanging identifiers with
                any others, because doing so could stymie your progress or
                pigeonhole you in a stereotype that could potentially thwart
                your eternal progression.</em

                sad it is when we honor labels more than we honor each
                other.</em

                course. Please do not misunderstand me. I am not saying that
                other designations and identifiers are not significant. I am
                simply saying that no identifier should displace, replace, or
                take priority over these three enduring designations: “child of
                God,” “child of the covenant,” and “disciple of Jesus Christ.”
                Any identifier that is not compatible with these three basic
                designations will ultimately let you down. Other labels will
                disappoint you in time because they do not have the power to
                lead you toward eternal life in the celestial kingdom of God.
                Worldly identifiers will never give you a vision of who you can
                ultimately become. They will never affirm your divine DNA or
                your unlimited, divine potential.</em

                You can pour out your heart to Him and trust Him to send the
                Holy Ghost and angels to care for you. He demonstrated His

                Christ working in your life? Seeking to answer these questions
                will require effort—much effort. I plead with you to take charge
                of your testimony. Work for it. Own it. Care for it. Nurture it
                so that it will grow. Feed it truth. Don't pollute it with the
                false philosophies of unbelieving men and women and then wonder
                why your testimony is waning. Engage in daily, earnest, humble
                prayer. Nourish yourself in the words of ancient and modern
                prophets. Ask the Lord to teach you how to hear Him better.
                Spend more time in the temple and in family history work. As you
                make your testimony your highest priority, watch for miracles to
                happen in your life.</em
